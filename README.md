## Single and Double Chamber Badges:

I made the Single Chamber badge to help test my Chamber SAO Adapter and L33T Badges.  And I made the Double Chamber badge to showcase both of those items while at DEF CON 31.  I ended up printing 6 extra Double Chamber badges and handed them out for free while at DC31.  Since those badges received a lot of compliments, I am listing the STLs here for you to use for personal projects.  
The STLs for the front and back cover of the chamber that were released by DEF CON are also in this repo.  You don't need the back cover, but it's included in case you want it.  

## Super Dooper Flipper Flooper:

The holder for the Super Duper Flipper Flooper also received a lot of compliments and while the STL is already available in the Flooper repo, I'm also including it here.  You are free to use it for personal projects.
